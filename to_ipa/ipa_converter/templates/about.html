    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
      ToIPA converts English or Spanish text into phonetic transcriptions in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). 
      Most current IPA converters only offer transcriptions at the phonemic level, 
      but ToIPA also provides narrow phonetic transcriptions. If you are unfamiliar with IPA, see this page, 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet">International Phonetic Alphabet</a>. 
      Transcriptions most accurately represent how words are pronounced in isolation.
    </p>
    <h5>English</h5>
    <p>
      The English transcriptions come from 
      <a href="https://github.com/lotusfa/IPA-Translator">IPA-Translator</a>, which itself comes from the CMU pronouncing dictionary.  
      These were modified using phonological rules from phoneticists Dr. Allard Jongman and Dr. Henning Reetz. 
      Transcriptions are based on General American English. Slashes between the IPA indicate multiple common pronunciations.
    </p>
    <h5>Spanish</h5>
    <p>
      The Spanish transcriptions, unlike the English transcriptions, are generated based on Spanish spelling. 
      The broad transcriptions are based on grapheme to phoneme rules from 
      <a href="http://elies.rediris.es/elies4/Cap6.htm#6.1.%20Reglas%20de%20transcripci%C3%B3n%20grafema-fonema">Reglas de transcripci√≥n grafema-fonema</a>. 
      The narrow transcriptions are based on data on allophones in Mexican Spanish from 
      <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10579-009-9109-9">The Corpus DIMEx100: transcription and evaluation</a>.
